            <h3>Small Cell -</h3>

            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>70% of mobile voice connections take place indoors. 80% of mobile data connections take place
                    indoors.To cater this exponential increase network needs to get closer to end user via DAS, Small
                    Cells and Wi-Fi Operators should take measures for solving for Capacity, not just Coverage.
                    Due to 4G rolling out by Dec-2015 in India, Telco’s will see a steep increase in the data
                    consumption by subscribers. Small cells network will help Telco’s and subscribers to overcome the
                    connectivity and coverage issues and scale up the network element capabilities in transferring data
                    and various services, with reduced deployment cost of network infrastructure.
                    Het-Nets will be able to solve the future requirements of increased capacity and higher data
                    speed.Operators will benefit from better value proposition, reduced churn rates, CapEx and OpEx
                    requirements. Small cells will also help in deploying successfully various government projects.
                </p>

                <h4>Deployment of Small cells:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Conducting survey in an area with high call drops and bad QoS.RF Survey, Customer input
                        analysis, Area layout analysis through surveys and Landscape Views of area.
                    </li>
                    <li>Planning for RF distribution network for installation of Macro cell (Pico Cells/Femto Cells) as
                        perrequirement.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cable route survey</li>
                    <li>Preparing BOQ</li>
                    <li>Installation of Small Cell Network as per drawing.</li>
                    <li>Walk test to understand the RF propagation behaviour</li>
                    <li>Recommendation on BSS parameters for desired Handover behaviour</li>
                    <li>Coverage confinement of Macro-cell</li>
                </ul>


                <h4>Drivers of Small Cells</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Growth in mobile data- Due to boom in smartphones and growing adoption of OTT (Over-the-top)
                        services by
                        consumers,Telcos around the world are witnessing huge data traffic volumes .
                    </li>
                    <li>Spectrum benefits of small cells</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>1. Benefits apply across wide range of spectrum bands :</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Performance is spectrum band agnostic</li>
                    <li>Standardised in all existing mobile bands from 700 MHz to 2.6GHz</li>
                    <li>Tolerant to interference from wide range of sources (e.g. Digital TV)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Reuse existing bands</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Rapid refarming without full clearance. E.g.: UMTS femtocells on GSM macro</li>
                    <li>Future potential for LTE refarming on 3G spectrum.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Spectrum and economic efficiencies</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Dense reuse and high interference protection give very high capacity</li>
                    <li>These capacity gains apply in low and high freq bands</li>
                    <li>Deep indoor coverage with lower cost and reduced environmental impact</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Innovation & competition</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Scope for new operators in limited spectrum</li>
                    <li>‘Inside-out’ femtocell-led deployments</li>
                    <li>New services and better customer experience</li>
